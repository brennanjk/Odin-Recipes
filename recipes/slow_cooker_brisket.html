  <h2>Beef brisket slow cooked until tender, then finished in the oven.</h2>

  <p>Brisket is a cut of beef made for slow cooking, not fast cooking. Itâ€™s unique characteristic compared to other slow cooking cuts of beef is 
    that it holds its shape even after hours and hours of slow cooking and can be sliced.</p>
  <p>We will prepare our Brisket with a dry rub, then combine it with BBQ sauce in our slow cooker. 
    We'll then finish preparing it in the oven to carmelize the sauce. 
    Slice it and serve as part of a hearty Southern style supper or pile it up high on sliders!</p>
